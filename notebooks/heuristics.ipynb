        "# Graph Coloring Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "The **graph coloring problem** can be described mathematically as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph, where:\n",
        "\n",
        "- V is the set of vertices (or nodes) of the graph.\n",
        "- E is the set of edges, where each edge e = (u, v) represents a connection between two vertices u and v.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to assign a color to each vertex in V such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The **chromatic number** χ(G) of the graph G is the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of the graph in this way. Formally:\n",
        "\n",
        "χ(G) = min { k : there exists a function f : V → {1, 2, ..., k} such that for all (u, v) ∈ E, f(u) ≠ f(v) }\n",

        "### Computational Complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "Determining the chromatic number χ(G) of a graph is a well-known **NP-hard** problem. This means that, in general, there is no efficient algorithm that can find the exact chromatic number for arbitrary graphs in polynomial time, unless P = NP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, finding the optimal solution (i.e., the exact chromatic number) is computationally expensive, especially for large graphs. This makes exact solutions impractical for real-world applications where graphs can have thousands or millions of vertices and edges.\n",

        "\n",
        "Given the difficulty of solving the graph coloring problem exactly, **heuristics** are commonly used to find approximate solutions. These heuristics aim to find a solution that is close to the optimal chromatic number, but in a much faster time frame.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **DSatur (Degree of Saturation)**: This heuristic prioritizes vertices based on the number of differently colored neighbors (saturation degree). The vertex with the highest saturation degree is colored first, as it has the least flexibility in terms of color assignment. The algorithm iteratively selects the vertex with the highest saturation degree and assigns it the lowest color that is not used by its neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Welsh-Powell**: This heuristic colors vertices in decreasing order of their degrees. The idea is that vertices with a high degree (more neighbors) are more constrained in terms of color choices and should be colored first.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **RLF (Recursive Largest First)**: This heuristic recursively selects the largest independent set of uncolored vertices, colors them, and then repeats the process with the remaining vertices. It prioritizes vertices based on their degree and the degree of their neighbors, aiming to minimize conflicts."
